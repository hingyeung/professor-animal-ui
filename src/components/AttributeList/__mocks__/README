Don’t forget to mock the BrowserRouter used by App.js by creating __mocks__/react-router-dom.js and here is how to mock it:

{code}
import React from 'react';
const rrd = require('react-router-dom');
// Just render plain div with its children
rrd.BrowserRouter = ({children}) => <div>{children}</div>
module.exports = rrd;
{code}

We need to mock it because it’ll overlap with our MemoryRouter and causing the initialEntries not working.
